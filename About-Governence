 # Governance Control for Review

## Governance Control Aspects

Governance control ensures compliance, security, and structured policy management with respect to:
- **Confidentiality**
- **Integrity**
- **Availability**

### Information Security Policy (ISP)
- Acts as the parent policy governing all security controls.
- Establishes overall security guidelines for the organization.

### Topic-Specific Policies
- Based on the Statement of Applicability (SOA) to determine relevant controls.
- Covers specific areas such as:
  - Access Control
  - Incident Management
  - Risk Assessment
  - Data Protection

### Policy Approval & Review Process
- Policies must be approved by top management before implementation.
- Policies should be reviewed at planned intervals to ensure relevance and updates.

### Policy Communication & Availability
- Defined policies should be published and communicated to all relevant stakeholders.
- Policies must be accessible to those responsible for compliance and enforcement.

### Procedure Documentation
- Establishing standard operating procedures (SOPs) for implementing governance controls.
- Ensuring alignment between policies and day-to-day security practices.

### Control Ownership
- Every control must have an assigned control owner.
- Policies are built by the **GRC Team Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)**.
- Control ownership for governance resides with the GRC Team, and policies must be approved by top management
