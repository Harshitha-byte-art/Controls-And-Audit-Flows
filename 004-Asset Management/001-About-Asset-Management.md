## Asset Definition

## Asset Management Framework (PPT Model)
Asset management is represented by the PPT model:

- **P - People**: Employees

Without these, the organization cannot function properly.

## Asset Management Scope

- Laptops
- Antivirus
- Servers
- Printers

## Types of Asset Management Control
Asset Management Control is divided into five types:

1. **Asset Inventory or Asset Registry**
2. **Acceptable Use of Information & Other Associated Assets**
3. **Return of Assets**
4. **Classification of Information**
5. **Labeling of Information**

---

### 1. Asset Inventory or Asset Registry
- Verify if an asset register is in place and up to date.
- Ensure every asset has an assigned to asset owner.
- Check if the end-of-lifecycle (EOL) is defined.
- Cross-check assets listed in the asset register with assets in the server room manually.
- If discrepancies are found, they must be documented as findings.

---

### 2. Acceptable Use of Information & Other Associated Assets
- Ensure compliance with the **Acceptable Usage Policy (AUP)**.
- The policy outlines the **do’s and don’ts** regarding asset usage.

---

### 3. Classification of Information (Assets)
- Assets are classified based on **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA)**.
- Classification depends on the type of data processed within the asset.
- Rating scale: **1 to 5**
- Asset classification varies based on **asset location**.

---

### 4. Labeling of Information
- Assign a **CIA value** to determine asset criticality rating.
- Classification levels based on ratings:
  - **High (10-15)**: Top Secret / Secret
  - **Medium (7-9)**: Confidential / Restricted
  - **Low (3-6)**: Unclassified / Public

---

### 5. Return of Assets
- When an employee leaves the company, they must **return assigned assets**.
- A **No Objection Certificate (NOC)** is issued upon asset return.
- In case of a job change, the employee must submit all company assets before exit.
- During audits, NOC certificates are verified to confirm the return of assets.
