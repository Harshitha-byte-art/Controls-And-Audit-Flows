# Governance Control for Review

## Governance Control Aspects

Governance control ensures compliance, security, and structured policy management with respect to:
- **Confidentiality**
- **Integrity**
- **Availability**

### Information Security Policy (ISP)
- Acts as the parent policy governing all security controls.
- Establishes overall security guidelines for the organization.

### Topic-Specific Policies
- Based on the Statement of Applicability (SOA) to determine relevant controls.
- Covers specific areas such as:
  - Access Control
  - Incident Management
  - Risk Assessment
  - Data Protection

### Policy Approval & Review Process
- Policies must be approved by top management before implementation.
- Policies should be reviewed at planned intervals to ensure relevance and updates.

### Policy Communication & Availability
- Defined policies should be published and communicated to all relevant stakeholders.
- Policies must be accessible to those responsible for compliance and enforcement.

### Procedure Documentation
- Establishing standard operating procedures (SOPs) for implementing governance controls.
- Ensuring alignment between policies and day-to-day security practices.

### Control Ownership
- Every control must have an assigned control owner.
- Policies are built by the **GRC Team Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)**.
- Control ownership for governance resides with the GRC Team, and policies must be approved by top management.

## Governance Audit Flow & Process

### Step 1: Identify
- **Identify the Control Owner**:
  - Conduct kick-off meetings to identify the control owner.
  - Capture control owner details:
    - Name
    - Designation
    - Email ID (for communication & inquiries)
- **Process-Related Governance Controls**:
  - Ensure policies and procedure documents are:
    - Up to date
    - Reviewed
    - Approved
    - Communicated at planned intervals

### Step 2: Inquiry
- Questions to ask:
  - Are policies and procedures updated, reviewed, and approved?
  - How is policy communication handled?
  - Are tools used, or is the process manual?

### Step 3: Walkthrough
- Conduct audit sampling and gather evidence.
- Verify that policies and procedure documents:
  - Are approved with **Segregation of Duties (SOD)**.
  - Are reviewed by different authorities.
  - Ensure compliance with **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA)** clauses.

### Evidence Collection
- Types of evidence:
  - Internal portals and emails.
  - Email screenshots with date & timestamp.
  - Source data in non-editable PDF format.

## Difference Between ISP and Topic-Specific Policies
| Aspect                  | Information Security Policy (ISP)         | Topic-Specific Policies        |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Scope**              | Organization-wide security policy         | Focuses on specific security areas |
| **Level of Detail**    | High-level, general principles            | Detailed rules and procedures  |
| **Purpose**            | Provides overall security framework       | Addresses specific security concerns |
| **Examples**           | Security governance, risk management      | Access control, incident response |

# People Control (HR) for Review

## Overview
**People control**, also known as HR Security, ensures that employees follow security protocols to minimize risks:
- **Before Employment**: Employee screening, background verification, and security agreements.
- **During Employment**: Security training, access control, and policy compliance.
- **After Employment**: Exit procedures, access revocation, and data protection.

### HR Security Compliance Lists (ISO 27001)
| HR List Type        | Purpose                                      |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Master Employee List** | Includes new employees (Before Employment) |
| **Active Employee List** | Includes current employees (During Employment) |
| **Exit List**         | Includes terminated employees (After Employment) |

## Phases of HR Security

### 1. Before Employment (Pre-Employment Screening & Onboarding)
#### Step 1: Background Verification (BGV) Check
- HR conducts **BGV checks** on all candidates.
- Procedures for BGV are documented in HR policy and procedure documents.

#### Step 2: Reviewing Policy & Procedure Documents
- Audit teams review HR policy and procedure documents to ensure alignment with compliance standards.
- Control activities must follow laws, regulations, and ethical hiring guidelines.

#### Step 3: Employment Terms & Agreements
- Employment contracts include:
  - Confidentiality Agreements (Non-Disclosure Agreements - NDA)
  - Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)
  - Data Protection Agreements
- Employees sign and acknowledge policies during onboarding.

#### Step 4: Sampling for Audit
- HR maintains records of new joiners.
- Sampling method for audit:
  - Total population data (e.g., 600 new employees).
  - A random sample of 25 employees is selected for review.
  - HR policies and agreements are checked for compliance.

### 2. During Employment
#### Information Security Awareness
- Regular training and updates for employees on relevant security policies.
- Evidence: Awareness training calendar and code of conduct.

#### Disciplinary Process
- Formal process for addressing security policy violations.

### 3. After Employment
#### Post-Employment Responsibilities
- Define and enforce security duties after employment ends.
- Evidence: Documented post-employment obligations.

#### Confidentiality Agreements
- Maintain and review confidentiality agreements (NDAs) to protect sensitive information.
- Evidence: Signed NDAs and review records.

## HR Control Audit Flow and Process

### Step 1: Identify the Control Owner
- Identify the Control Owner (CO) via kick-off meetings.
- Capture information:
  - Name
  - Designation
  - Email ID

### Step 2: Inquiry
- Conduct inquiry with the Control Owner (CO) on HR procedures.
- Sample questions:
  - What laws and regulations apply during BGV?
  - Is BGV conducted by your organization or a third party?
    - If third-party: Are reports shared in a template format?
  - Is BGV completed within 90 days of joining?
    - If delayed (e.g., 240 days), record as a deviation.

#### Deviation/Gap Identification
- If BGV is delayed, identify as a deviation.
- Management justification (e.g., "COVID-19 lockdown delays").

### Step 3: Walkthrough
- Conduct testing, sampling, and evidence gathering:
  - Over-the-shoulder testing (e.g., screen-sharing session).
  - If no evidence is gathered, document it.
  - Mask IT data to preserve employee confidentiality.
- **Sampling**:
  - Create a master list.
  - Select a sample for evidence collection.
  - Collect BGV reports to confirm compliance.

#### Core Points for Review
- **Tools**: Are tools used to maintain BGV control?
- **Evidence Sufficiency**: Is the evidence sufficient?
- **Accountability**: Who is accountable for this control?
- **Evidence Confirmation**: Are gathered documents verifiable?
