# Access Control for Review

Access control ensures that only authorized individuals can access information systems, data, and resources based on business requirements and security policies.  

It helps to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and insider threats while ensuring compliance with security regulations.

## Physical Access  
Controls access to physical locations (e.g., buildings, data centers).  

- Prevents unauthorized entry into sensitive locations.  
- Protects employees, assets, and critical infrastructure.  

## Logical Access  
Controls access to applications, networks, and servers.  

- Restricts access to applications, servers, networks, and cloud resources.  

### Example:  
- Employees need usernames and passwords to log into company email systems.  
- Developers are given access only to specific project repositories on GitHub.  

## (JML) Process
