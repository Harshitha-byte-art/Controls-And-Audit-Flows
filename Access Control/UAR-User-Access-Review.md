# User Access Review (UAR)

User Access Review (UAR) is a critical control mechanism to ensure that only authorized users have access to applications and infrastructure. The primary goal of UAR is to prevent unauthorized access, minimize security risks, and maintain compliance with regulatory and internal security policies.

## Key Scenarios Identified in UAR:

- **Users leave a team but still retain access privileges** – Employees who transition to a different team may still have access to applications or systems that are no longer relevant to their new role.
- **Users change roles but still have access privileges from previous roles** – When employees are promoted or reassigned, their old access rights should be reviewed and revoked if unnecessary.
- **Users leave the enterprise but still have access privileges** – Employees who exit the company should have all access revoked immediately to prevent potential security breaches.
- **Dormant Accounts** – User accounts that are inactive for an extended period may pose security risks if left unchecked.

## Review Frequency Based on Access Type:

- **Privileged Access** (Admin, Superuser, or Elevated Rights) → **Monthly UAR**
- **Normal Access** (Regular user accounts with standard permissions) → **Half-Yearly UAR**
