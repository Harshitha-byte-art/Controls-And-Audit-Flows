## Objective
Ensure that dormant (unused) accounts are identified, and access revocation is properly conducted.

## Audit Flow Steps

### STEP 1: Identify the Control Owner (CO) via Kickoff Meetings

#### Key Questions for Inquiry:
- What is the procedure for access reviews?
- How are inactive/dormant accounts identified and revoked?
- Are there exceptions, and how are they handled?

### STEP 3: Walkthrough – Audit, Sampling & Evidence Collection

#### Walkthrough Process:
- Conduct a walkthrough session with the Control Owner (CO).
- Record CO’s Name, Designation, and Timestamp for documentation.

  - **Normal User:** Collect Minutes of Meeting (MoM) from one UAR meeting.
  - **Admin/Privileged Users:** Collect MoM from two to three UAR meetings.

#### Testing and Evidence Gathering:
- **Sampling:** Verify a subset of user access logs and account revocations.
