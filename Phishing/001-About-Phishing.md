## 2. Understanding Phishing and Social Engineering

### What is Phishing?

#### Definition:
- Phishing is a type of social engineering attack where hackers send emails or messages that appear to come from legitimate organisations—such as banks, government agencies, or trusted companies—to trick recipients into revealing sensitive information.

#### Common Tactics:
- **Fraudulent Emails:**  
  The emails often mimic the look and feel of a genuine source, complete with logos and familiar language.
- **Links and Attachments:**  
  Recipients may be tricked into clicking on a link or opening an attachment that either leads to a fake website (to steal credentials) or installs malware on your computer.

#### Warning Signs (Red Flags):
- Urgent or threatening language intended to prompt immediate action.
- Unexpected requests for personal or financial information.
- Email addresses or domain names that are slightly off from the authentic ones.
- Poor grammar or spelling errors in the communication.

### What is Social Engineering?

#### Definition:
- Social engineering is a broader term that covers any tactic used by attackers to manipulate, influence, or deceive individuals into performing actions or divulging confidential information.

#### Core Tactics:
- **Influencing:**  
  Convincing a person to act in a certain way by building trust.
- **Manipulating:**  
  Exploiting a person’s emotions or urgency to induce mistakes.
- **Deceiving:**  
  Presenting false information that leads to poor decision-making.

#### Key Insight:
- Social engineering often relies on creating a sense of urgency, making the target feel pressured to act without fully assessing the situation.
- The best way to counteract this is to stay calm and verify the legitimacy of any request or message.

### Other Related Terms

#### Smishing:
- **Definition:**  
  Phishing attacks delivered via SMS (text messages).
- **Prevention:**  
  Do not click on links from unknown phone numbers and be cautious even if the message appears urgent.

#### Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:
- **Definition:**  
  An attack where a hacker intercepts communication between you and a trusted party, potentially stealing information like login credentials.
- **Prevention:**  
  Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) when connecting to public Wi-Fi networks to secure your data transmission.

## 3. The Threat Landscape and Hackers' Methods

### How Hackers Exploit Vulnerabilities

#### Creativity in Attack Methods:
- Hackers are continually evolving their techniques to bypass security measures.
- Their creativity allows them to combine various attack methods.

#### Primary Threat - Social Engineering:
- Most modern attacks are grounded in social engineering.
- Hackers exploit human psychology—trust, fear, and urgency—to gain access to sensitive information.

#### Phishing as a Core Technique:
- Among all social engineering techniques, phishing is one of the most prevalent.
- It leverages email, SMS, or even phone calls to convince targets to provide sensitive data or download harmful content.

### Recognising and Responding to Threats

#### Recognise the Warning Signs:
- Look out for messages that create a false sense of urgency or fear.
- Check for inconsistencies in sender information.
- Be wary of unexpected attachments or links.

#### Take Action:
- Do not respond immediately to suspicious messages.
- Verify requests through alternative communication channels (for example, call your IT department or the supposed sender directly).
- Report suspicious emails or messages to your organisation’s security team immediately.

## 4. Prevention and Best Practices

### For End Users:

#### Stay Informed:
- Regular training and updates will keep you informed about the latest phishing techniques.

#### Verify Before You Act:

#### Use Security Tools:
- Ensure your email client or browser is equipped with anti-phishing features.
- Utilize VPNs when accessing public networks.
- Keep your software and antivirus programs up to date.

### For Organisations:

#### Conduct Phishing Campaigns:
- Regularly simulate phishing attacks to test employee awareness and response.
- These campaigns help identify vulnerabilities in your training program.

#### Implement Anti-Phishing Measures:
- Use advanced email filtering and threat detection systems to reduce the likelihood of phishing emails reaching users.

#### Continuous Improvement:
- Based on the outcomes of training and simulated attacks, update your policies and training material to address new threat vectors.
