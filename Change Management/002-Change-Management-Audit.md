# Change Management Audit Process â€“ Detailed Flow

## Objective:
The Change Management audit aims to verify whether all changes to IT systems, applications, and services are controlled, approved, and managed as per the organizationâ€™s Change Management Policy. The audit will check compliance with governance controls, approval workflows, testing procedures, and documentation.

## Audit Process Steps

### Step 1: Identify the Control Owner via Kickoff Meetings
- Conduct kickoff meetings to identify the **Control Owner (CO)** responsible for Change Management.
- Verify that **Change Management (CM)** ensures all changes are **controlled, approved, and managed** as per policy.
- Confirm **change classification**:
  - **Standard Change** â†’ Pre-approved by **CAB Team**.
  - **Normal Change** â†’ Follows **full Change Management Process**.
  - **Emergency Change** â†’ Applied immediately (e.g., cyberattacks), approvals obtained post-implementation.

### Step 2: Inquiry â€“ Process Verification & Governance Controls
- Gather the **Change Management Procedure** and confirm compliance.
- Verify the **Change Management Tool**:
  - ITSM (e.g., **ServiceNow, JIRA**) is used for **logging, approving, and reviewing changes**.
- Check the **Change Approval Matrix**:
  - Approvals from **CAB Team, Customer, and Manager**.
- Check for **Post Implementation Review (PIR)**:
  - Who conducts the PIR?
  - How is it documented?
- **Testing Requirements:**
  - Ensure that **UAT Testing** is conducted in a **lower environment** before moving to production.

### Step 3: Walkthrough â€“ Audit, Sampling, & Evidence Collection
1. **Conduct a Walkthrough with the Control Owner (CO):**
   - Document **Name, Designation, and Timestamp** of the meeting.
   - Request access to the **ITSM Dashboard** to list changes from **Feb 2022 â€“ Feb 2023**.
   - Total Changes Logged: **254 Change Tickets** during the audit period.

2. **Verify Closure & Approval Status:**
   - Before sampling, check if **all 254 tickets are closed and approved**.

3. **Perform Sampling:**
   - **Select 25 sample change tickets** for detailed review.
   - For each sampled change, verify:
     - **Request for Change (RFC) Details:**
       - Who requested the change?
       - What was the change?
       - Why was it required?
     - **Approval Process:**
       - Were approvals obtained from **CAB, Customer, and Manager**?
       - Check if approvals are documented.
     - **Separation of Duties (SoD) Compliance:**
       - Ensure different personnel handled:
         - Request submission
         - CAB approval
         - PIR execution
     - **Testing (UAT) and Validation:**
       - Was the change **implemented in a test environment first**?
       - Was **UAT successful or failed**?
     - **Customer Approvals:**
       - Verify customer sign-off before production deployment.
     - **Production Implementation & Documentation:**
       - Confirm that the change was implemented in the production environment.
       - Check production deployment logs.
     - **Post Implementation Review (PIR):**
       - Was the PIR conducted and documented?
     - **Rollback Plan (RBP) Compliance:**
       - If the change failed, was a rollback plan executed properly?

## Audit Checklist â€“ Evidence Collection
During the audit, the following evidence should be collected to verify compliance with the Change Management process:

### 1. Request and Approval Evidence
âœ… Request from **the requester** (Emails, ITSM Ticket, Audit Findings)  
âœ… **Change Ticket** with details (Logged in ITSM)  
âœ… **Request for Change (RFC) Form** (Mandatory for production changes)  
âœ… **Approval Records** (Customer, Manager, CAB, GRC Team)  

### 2. Implementation and Testing Evidence
âœ… **UAT Reports** (Testing in Lower Environment)  
âœ… **Validation Reports** (Successful or Failed UAT)  
âœ… **Production Change Implementation Reports**  

### 3. Post-Implementation and Compliance Evidence
âœ… **Customer Approval for Production Deployment**  
âœ… **PIR Documentation** (Who performed it? Findings?)  
âœ… **Rollback Plan Execution (if applicable)**  
âœ… **Change Ticket Closure Confirmation**  

## Audit Conclusion
At the end of the audit, the findings will determine:

- **Compliance Level:** Whether the Change Management process follows governance policies.
- **Gaps & Risks:** If there are any missing approvals, incomplete UAT, or skipped PIR reviews.
- **Actionable Recommendations:** Steps to improve compliance and process adherence.

By following this structured **audit approach**, organizations ensure that **IT changes are properly managed**, minimizing **risks, downtime, and security threats** while maintaining **process integrity**. ðŸš€
