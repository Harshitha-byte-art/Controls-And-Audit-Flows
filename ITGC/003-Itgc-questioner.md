# Understanding IT General Controls (ITGC) and the Questionnaire Process

IT General Controls (ITGC) ensure the **security, integrity, and reliability** of an organization's IT environment. These controls are crucial for **compliance with SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley) and other regulatory requirements** to prevent financial fraud, protect sensitive data, and maintain stakeholder trust.

## Why is an ITGC Questionnaire Needed?
Before conducting ITGC testing, auditors send a **questionnaire** to the client. This helps in:

✅ Identifying **in-scope applications and IT systems**  
✅ Understanding the **IT control structure** (who is responsible for what)  
✅ Checking whether **IT policies and procedures** are documented and followed  
✅ Assessing controls for **user access, change management, and security**  
✅ Gathering evidence such as **policy documents, logs, and configurations**

## Steps in the ITGC Audit Process

### 1. Identifying In-Scope Applications
Not all IT systems are relevant for ITGC testing. Auditors **focus on applications** that are:

- **Financially significant** (ERP, accounting, payroll, HR, business-critical apps)
- **Third-party or outsourced** applications that impact financial reporting

#### Steps to Identify In-Scope Applications:
1️⃣ **Review System Inventory** – Get a list of all IT systems used by the company.  
2️⃣ **Assess Financial Impact** – Focus on applications that affect financial transactions.  
3️⃣ **Check Data Flow & Integration** – Identify links with financial systems (e.g., CRM, billing).  
4️⃣ **Confirm with Management** – Senior management decides the final audit scope.

### 2. Performing Walkthroughs
A **walkthrough** is a step-by-step demonstration of how an IT control operates in real life.

#### Why Conduct Walkthroughs?
✔️ **Validates client responses** in the questionnaire  
✔️ **Confirms IT controls** are implemented correctly  
✔️ **Ensures processes match documented policies**  

#### Walkthrough Process:
📅 **Schedule a Meeting** – Meet with IT and business teams managing in-scope applications.  
🔎 **Observe and Ask Questions:**  
- How is user access granted or revoked?  
- What happens when an employee leaves?  
- How are system changes approved and tested?  

📂 **Gather Supporting Evidence (Control Activity Evidence - CHA):**  
- Screenshots of system settings  
- Sample logs of user access and changes  
- Documentation of approval workflows  

---

### 3. Higher Management Determines Scope
Senior management and auditors finalize the **ITGC testing scope** based on:

✅ Risk assessment  
✅ Regulatory requirements  
✅ Company policies  

Some controls may be **excluded** if they have a **low financial impact** or are not relevant to the audit.
