# Logging and Monitoring: A Simple Explanation

Logging and monitoring are essential for tracking system activities, detecting security threats, and ensuring compliance. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of key aspects:

## 1. Event Logging

Every action in a system (e.g., user logins, logouts, errors, and system events) must be logged. These logs help track what happened, when, and who was involved.

## 2. Centralized Log Storage

Instead of storing logs separately for each application, they can be sent to a **central server** using a **syslog server**. This makes it easier to manage and analyze logs from different sources.

## 3. Protecting Logs

Logs should be **protected** from unauthorized access, modification, or deletion. Attackers often erase logs to cover their tracks, so access must be restricted to only authorized personnel.

## 4. Log Analysis

Regularly reviewing logs helps detect **unusual activity, errors, or security incidents** early. Security teams use tools like **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** solutions such as **Splunk** or **QRadar** to automate this process.

## Clock Synchronization (NTP - Network Time Protocol)

To ensure all logs have accurate timestamps, all system clocks must be synchronized using **NTP servers**.

- Every device in the system should follow the same **time zone and timestamp** (e.g., **5 July 2024, 20:00:00 PM IST**).
- An **NTP server** maintains consistent and accurate time across all assets.
- This is crucial for **security auditing and tracking incidents correctly**.

### How to Verify Clock Synchronization?
1. **Inquiry:** Ask how the organization ensures clock synchronization.
2. **Walkthrough:** Check NTP server configuration and whether endpoints (devices) are syncing correctly.
3. **Evidence Collection:**
   - Capture **screenshots** of NTP server settings.
   - Verify if devices are synced to the correct **NTP server**.
   - Compare timestamps across different logs to ensure consistency.

## Why is This Important?
- **Ensures accountability** (knowing who did what and when).
- Helps in **investigations and audits**.
- Prevents issues caused by **time mismatches** in log records.
