# Internal Audit with Respect to SOC 2, ISO 27001, and NIST CSF

Internal audits in the context of **SOC 2, ISO 27001, and NIST CSF** focus on assessing and ensuring that an organization's **information security controls** and **practices** are in line with these specific frameworks. These audits help demonstrate the organization's commitment to **protecting sensitive data** and **maintaining a secure environment**. The role of the **auditee** and the responsibilities involved in the process are vital for a successful audit outcome.

## **Role: Auditee**

An **auditee** is the organization being audited. The auditee is responsible for:

- Providing the auditors with the necessary **information, documentation, and access to systems** as per the scope of the audit.
- Ensuring that **internal processes and controls** align with the standards and frameworks being audited (**SOC 2, ISO 27001, or NIST CSF**).
- Coordinating with **auditors** throughout the process.

## **Difference Between Auditee and Auditor**

- **Auditee**: The organization being audited. They provide **evidence, documentation, and access to internal systems and personnel**, and ensure that the necessary **controls** are in place.
- **Auditor**: The external party (such as a **CPA firm or third-party audit firm like KPMG**) that conducts the audit. They assess the auditee’s **processes, controls, and compliance** against the specific framework (**SOC 2, ISO 27001, NIST CSF**). Auditors typically provide **findings, recommendations, and the final audit report**.

## **Steps in Internal Audit Process**

### **Step 1: Kick-off Meeting**

The **kick-off meeting** is the first official meeting between the **auditee (internal team)** and the **auditors**. During this meeting, several key activities take place:

- **Introduction of Stakeholders**: Internal audit team members (**GRC team, control owners**) meet with the external auditors.
- **Scope and Objectives Clarification**: The scope of the audit (**SOC 2, ISO 27001, or NIST CSF**) is discussed. The external auditor will explain the **specific areas they will assess** and the **objectives of the audit**.
- **Control Owner Identification**: The **control owners** from the auditee side are identified. These individuals are responsible for ensuring that the **necessary controls and evidence** are in place.
- **Audit Methodology**: External auditors explain the **audit techniques** they will use (**walkthroughs, inspection of evidence, and observation of processes**). They will also clarify what **documentation and systems** they will review.
- **Timeline and Milestones**: Timelines for the audit process, including **key milestones**, will be set to ensure everything stays on track.

## **Audit Techniques**

During the audit, the following techniques will be used to assess the organization’s controls:

- **Walkthroughs**: Auditors will walk through the organization’s **processes** to ensure that the controls are being implemented effectively.
- **Inspection of Evidence**: Auditors will examine the **relevant documents, records, and system configurations** to confirm that the processes and controls are functioning as expected.
- **Observation of Processes**: Auditors will observe actual **processes and workflows** to ensure compliance with **internal policies and controls**.

---

## **Audit Requests**

After the kick-off meeting, the **external auditors** will share **Audit Request Lists** for all the controls within the scope of the audit. The internal team (**auditee**) will need to:

- **Gather the Evidence**: The internal team (often led by the **SPOC – Single Point of Contact**) is responsible for gathering the required evidence for each control. This may include **documentation** such as **procedures, system logs, reports**, and other relevant data.
- **Upload Evidence to Audit Portal**: Once the evidence is collected, it must be **uploaded to the audit portal** (e.g., **KPMG Portal**), where auditors can access and review it.

---

## **SPOC Roles and Responsibilities**

The **SPOC (Single Point of Contact)** is responsible for coordinating the audit process internally. Their responsibilities include:

1. **Kick-off Meetings**: Ensuring all relevant internal team members are present and the **scope is understood**.
2. **Audit Request List and Control Assignment**: Ensuring that the audit requests are assigned to the relevant **control owners** and that **progress is tracked** (often managed via tools like **SmartSheet**).
3. **Supporting Walkthroughs and Inquiries**: Helping the **auditors** during walkthroughs and providing answers to any **inquiries** they may have about the organization’s processes.
4. **Gathering and Confirming Evidence**: Collecting evidence and verifying its **accuracy, completeness, and relevance**.
5. **Uploading Evidence**: Ensuring that evidence is **properly uploaded** to the **audit portal** in a timely manner.
6. **Monitoring and Tracking Audit Requests**: Keeping track of all **requests** and ensuring that all **deadlines** are met. If there are **delays or issues**, escalations will be made as necessary.

## **Dashboard for External Audit**

To monitor the audit process, a **dashboard** is typically used to track the status of each audit request. The dashboard will include the following statuses:

- **OPEN**: If the evidence has not been provided yet.
- **FULFILLED**: If the evidence has been provided, but the auditor has not yet reviewed it.
- **COMPLETE**: If the evidence has been reviewed and accepted by the auditor.
- **REJECTED**: If the evidence was rejected or additional information is needed.
- **Comments/Feedback**: Auditors may leave **comments** if they require further clarification or if there is an **issue** with the provided evidence.

---

## **Specific Audit Techniques and Processes**

- **BGV (Background Verification)**: The **Control Owner** may need to provide **documents** such as **Procedure Documents** or access to **systems** for review.
- **Walkthrough**: The **external auditors** will go through a **Master List** of controls, possibly selecting a **sample (e.g., 485)** to ensure that the control is being **implemented and working** as intended.
- **Sampling and Evidence Gathering**: The **auditors** will **sample specific transactions, activities, or controls** and gather **evidence** to confirm that the controls are being **followed**.

---

## **Final Reporting**

- **SOC 2 Attestation**: This is a **formal statement** by the auditor verifying that the organization **meets the requirements** for **SOC 2 compliance**.
- **NIST CSF Attestation**: Similar to **SOC 2**, this involves confirming that the **organization’s controls align** with the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**.
- **ISO 27001 Certification**: This is a **formal certification** issued when an organization is found to be in **full compliance** with **ISO 27001**, which focuses on **information security management systems (ISMS)**.

---

## **Summary**

- The **auditee** provides the necessary **evidence, documentation, and cooperation** throughout the audit process.
- **Audit requests** are issued by the **external auditor**, and the **SPOC** ensures that these requests are **fulfilled and tracked properly**.
- **Audit techniques** such as **walkthroughs, inspections, and observations** are used to assess the **effectiveness of the controls**.
- **SOC 2, ISO 27001, and NIST CSF** audits involve specific **requirements and certifications** that are crucial for organizations to demonstrate their commitment to **data security and compliance**.
