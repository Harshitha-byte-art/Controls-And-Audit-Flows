# Data Center Control for Review

## Data Center Overview
A **data center** is a special building where **computers, servers, and storage devices** are kept to **store, process, and manage data**. It helps businesses, cloud services, and governments run their digital operations **smoothly and securely**.

---

## 1. Risk Avoidance and Internal Maintenance

- **Avoiding risks**: Companies implement strict security measures to prevent risks such as **unauthorized access, data breaches, and downtime** due to system failures.
- **Internal maintenance**: Organizations **manage security internally** and ensure **compliance** with industry standards.

---

## 2. Data Center Hosting & Third-Party Services

- Companies opt for **dedicated data centers** instead of maintaining infrastructure **on-premises**.
- **Third-party data centers (Colocation providers)**: Some organizations choose **third-party (3rd party) data centers** to host their servers. These are often referred to as **"Lendals"** or **Colocation Providers**.

## 3. Physical Security Layers in Data Centers

Data centers have **six layers of security** to ensure the protection of data and physical infrastructure:

### **Perimeter Security (Anti-Climb Measures)**
- **High boundary fencing** with anti-climb technology to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Security guards** verifying identities of anyone attempting to enter.

### **CCTV Surveillance**
- **24/7, 365-day video monitoring** of the premises.
- Footage is monitored from a **Security Operations Center (SOC)** to detect suspicious activities.

### **Security Perimeter (Bollards & Gates)**
- **Barrier gates (Boom gates)** are installed at entry points to prevent unauthorized vehicles from entering.

### **Restricted Access Areas**
- Only **authorized personnel** can access critical infrastructure.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** is mandatory for entry.

### **Security Monitoring Teams**
- **SOC (Security Operations Center)** teams constantly monitor camera feeds and access logs.
- Any **suspicious activity** is flagged and investigated.

### **End-of-Life (EOL) Data Destruction**
- Old **hard drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs)** must be securely destroyed to prevent data leaks.
- **Destruction methods include:**
  - **HDD Degaussing** (erasing magnetic fields).
  - **SSD Shielding/Puncturing** (physically damaging the drives).

## 4. Physical Security Audits & Controls

One of the key security controls in data centers is **Physical Security**, which includes:

### **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for Access**

### **Visitor Logs:**
- Every visitor must **sign in** and provide **identification**.
- Logs are regularly checked to ensure they are **up-to-date**.

### **BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) Policy:**
- **Personal devices** (laptops, USBs, mobile phones) are **blocked or sealed** before entering sensitive areas.
- **Camera ports** on personal devices may be **sealed** to prevent unauthorized recordings.
- Employees must **sign an undertaking** that states they will **follow security policies**.

### **Resetting Authentication Factors:**
- If a **2FA method** is compromised, the user must **reset authentication** using a **secure process**.

---

## 5. Security Testing Approaches

Security teams conduct **regular tests** to ensure compliance with **security policies**. There are two main types of testing:

### **Positive Testing (Expected Behavior Tests)**
- Check whether **2FA authentication** is enforced properly.
- Verify if **access is granted only to authorized personnel**.
- Ensure **logs are recorded and updated correctly**.

### **Negative Testing (Failure Scenarios)**
- Attempt access with **incorrect credentials** or **invalid IDs** to ensure the system properly **denies entry**.
- Use an **unauthorized device** to verify whether the **BYOD policy** is enforced.
