# Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) Meetings

In the context of **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)**, various meetings are held to ensure smooth progress and effective collaboration between the organization and external auditors. Here's a breakdown of each type of meeting:

## 1. Kick-off Meeting (Initial Stage)

The **Kick-off Meeting** is the first formal meeting between the **External Auditors** (typically from a CPA firm like **Big 4**) and the **Auditee**, which in this case includes the **GRC Team** and **Control Owners (CO)** within the organization (e.g., **Workday**). This meeting marks the beginning of the audit or compliance process. During this meeting, the following activities typically occur:

### Key Activities:

- **Introduction of Key Stakeholders**: Introductions are made between the internal team (**GRC Team and Control Owners**) and external auditors. This is crucial to establish a good working relationship and clarify roles.
- **Audit Scope and Objectives**: The external auditors outline the scope of their audit or review, defining what they will evaluate, their methodology, and the timelines for completion. This sets expectations for all parties involved.
- **Understanding the Organization's Controls and Processes**: The auditors will get an overview of the organization’s internal controls, policies, and procedures, which they will later assess.
- **Control Owner Identification**: **Control Owners (CO)** are identified and assigned based on different control areas within the organization. These individuals play a key role in ensuring the internal controls are in place and functioning effectively.
- **Compliance Requirements**: A discussion around the **legal, regulatory, and industry-specific compliance requirements** relevant to the audit process. The external auditors will provide an overview of the compliance standards that need to be met.
- **Documentation and Access Requirements**: The auditors outline the **documentation they require** for the audit and discuss how they will gain access to it. This includes internal policies, reports, and system access.
- **Timeline and Milestones**: A clear **timeline** will be discussed, including **key milestones** and **deadlines** for specific deliverables. This helps everyone involved track progress and stay aligned.

## 2. Weekly and Monthly Status Calls

Once the audit process begins, **Weekly and Monthly Status Calls** are held between the **internal team (GRC Team and Control Owners)** and **external auditors** to track progress and resolve any issues.

### Key Discussion Points:

- **Progress Updates**: A review of what has been accomplished since the last meeting, including whether deadlines were met and if the process is on track.
- **Identifying Issues**: Any **roadblocks or challenges** encountered during the audit process are discussed. This could include **delays in obtaining documentation**, **questions about internal controls**, or **other hurdles**.
- **Clarifications and Adjustments**: If there are any **misunderstandings** or areas that need further clarification, this is the opportunity to address them.
- **Preparation for Next Steps**: Planning for the **next phase of the audit or review**, including preparation of materials or actions that need to be taken before the next meeting.

## 3. Review Meetings (USR, Backup Review, Policy and Procedure)

**Review Meetings** are typically scheduled throughout the audit process to discuss specific areas of focus. Some types of review meetings include:

### Types of Review Meetings:

- **USR (User Access Review)**: This meeting focuses on reviewing **user access controls**, ensuring that only authorized personnel have access to **sensitive data and systems**. The auditors will assess whether the organization's **user access policies** are adequate and being followed correctly.
- **Backup Review**: This meeting reviews the **backup procedures** in place to ensure that the organization's data is being **backed up properly** and can be **recovered** in case of a disaster. The auditors evaluate the **backup frequency, methods, and retention policies** to ensure they meet compliance standards.
- **Policy and Procedure Review**: During this meeting, **internal policies and procedures** are examined to ensure they are **effective** and in line with the necessary **regulations and best practices**. The auditors will assess the documentation for **completeness, accuracy, and relevance** to the organization's **risk management framework**.

## Key Points to Remember:

- **External Auditors** (**CPA Firms, e.g., Big 4**) assess the organization’s **internal controls, processes, and compliance** with relevant standards.
- **Control Owners** are **key individuals** within the organization identified during the **Kick-off Meeting**, responsible for overseeing **specific controls**.
- The **GRC Team** facilitates **communication** and ensures that the organization remains in **compliance with regulations**.
- Regular **Status Calls** help maintain progress, address any **issues**, and ensure **timelines** are adhered to.
- These meetings are part of a **structured and ongoing process** to ensure that the organization’s **risk management, compliance, and control frameworks** are in good standing, with all parties remaining **aligned on objectives and outcomes**.
