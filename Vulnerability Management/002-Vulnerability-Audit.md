# **Vulnerability Management – Audit Flow**

## **1. Introduction to Vulnerability Management Audit**
A Vulnerability Management Audit ensures that an organization’s vulnerability management process is **effective, compliant, and follows established security controls**. The audit assesses whether vulnerabilities are **identified, prioritized, and remediated within the defined SLAs** (Service Level Agreements).

---

## **2. Audit Control Domain: Vulnerability Management Lifecycle**
The audit follows a **structured approach**, covering key areas of **vulnerability management controls**:

### **2.1 Key Steps in the Vulnerability Management Lifecycle**

| **Step** | **Process** | **Description** | **Output** |
|----------|------------|----------------|------------|
| **Step 1: Vulnerability Identification** | Scanning | Identify vulnerabilities using automated tools like **Qualys or Nessus**. | Vulnerability scan report |
| **Step 2: Vulnerability Reporting** | Preliminary Report | Document scan results and categorize vulnerabilities. | Vulnerability report |
| **Step 3: Vulnerability Prioritization** | Final Risk Calculation | Categorize vulnerabilities as **Critical, High, Medium, or Low** using a risk matrix. | Final risk report for management |
| **Step 4: Vulnerability Remediation** | Patching / Upgrades | Apply necessary security patches, updates, or configurations to mitigate vulnerabilities. | Remediated vulnerabilities |
| **Step 5: Vulnerability Closure** | Re-scanning | Verify if vulnerabilities are fixed and ensure closure within SLA timelines. | Closed vulnerability status report |
| **SLA Breach Handling** | Risk Acceptance Form (RAF) | If vulnerabilities are not fixed within SLA, a **RAF is generated** and approved by management. | RAF tracking and approval |

## **3. Audit Flow – Step-by-Step Process**
The **audit process** consists of three major steps:

1. **Identify Control Ownership (Kickoff Meeting)**  
2. **Inquiry (Process Review and Documentation Collection)**  
3. **Walkthrough (Testing, Sampling, and Evidence Collection)**  

---

## **STEP 1: Identifying the Control Owner – Kickoff Meeting**
The audit begins by identifying the **Control Owner (CO)**, typically from the **Security Operations Center (SOC) team**.

### **Key Activities:**
✔️ Conduct **Kickoff Meeting** to introduce audit scope and objectives.  
✔️ Identify the **Control Owner (CO)** responsible for vulnerability management.  
✔️ Collect **CO details**: Name, Designation, and Timestamp.  
✔️ Understand the **existing vulnerability management process and tools used** (e.g., **Qualys, Nessus**).  

🔹 **Example:**
- **Control Owner:** John Doe  
- **Designation:** SOC Lead  
- **Meeting Date:** 14th February 2025  
- **Tool Used:** Qualys  

---

## **STEP 2: Inquiry – Process Review and Documentation Collection**
During the inquiry phase, auditors review the **organization’s vulnerability management procedures** and collect necessary documentation.

### **Key Activities:**
✔️ **Gather vulnerability procedure documents.**  
✔️ Confirm whether the organization uses **Qualys, Nessus, or any other tools** for scanning.  
✔️ Check if **all assets** are updated in the **Qualys tool dashboard**.  
✔️ Verify that **assets in the tool match the asset register**.  
✔️ Confirm the **scan frequency** (Quarterly, Half-Yearly, Yearly).  
✔️ **Assess prioritization and risk classification:**  
   - Use the **risk matrix** to categorize vulnerabilities as **High, Medium, or Low**.  
   - Define SLA for **remediation timelines**.  
✔️ Verify if **SLA breaches are documented in the RAF process**.  

### **Key Evidence Collected:**
📄 **Vulnerability Management Policy & Procedure Document**  
📄 **List of Assets (Asset Register)**  
📄 **Scan Frequency Report**  
📄 **Risk Prioritization & SLA Document**  
📄 **RAF Records (if SLA is breached)**  

---

## **STEP 3: Walkthrough – Testing, Sampling, and Evidence Collection**
The walkthrough phase involves **practical testing**, **evidence gathering**, and **audit sampling** to validate the effectiveness of vulnerability management controls.

### **Key Activities:**
✔️ **Confirm Asset Inventory:**  
   - Verify that **all assets (servers, laptops, desktops, network devices)** are **mapped correctly** in the Qualys dashboard.  
   - Compare the **list of assets in Qualys** with the **official asset inventory register**.  
✔️ **Review Scan Reports for the Audit Period (Feb 2022 – Feb 2023):**  
   - Check scan results from **Half-Yearly (H1, H2) and Quarterly scans**.  
   - Assess **number of identified vulnerabilities** in each scan.  
   - Check **status of vulnerabilities** (Closed, Open, SLA Breached).  
✔️ **Audit Sampling Approach:**  
   - Select **25 random vulnerabilities** from the scan reports.  
   - Check their **remediation status** and **SLA compliance**.  
   - If SLA is breached, request **RAF details (Risk Acceptance Form ID)**.  

---

## **4. SLA Breach Handling & Risk Acceptance Process**
If a vulnerability is **not remediated within the SLA**, a **Risk Acceptance Form (RAF) is generated** and approved by **top management**.

### **RAF Approval Process:**
1. **SLA Breach Identified** → A vulnerability remains open beyond the SLA.  
2. **Risk Acceptance Form (RAF) is generated** → Unique RAF ID is assigned.  
3. **Approval Required from:**  
   - **Department Head**  
   - **Asset Owner**  
   - **Top Management (CISO, CIO, or equivalent)**  
4. **RAF is tracked and documented** for compliance purposes.  

### **Example RAF Record:**  

| **Vulnerability ID** | **Affected System** | **Risk Level** | **SLA Breach Date** | **RAF ID** | **Approval Status** |
|----------------|------------------|------------|----------------|---------|--------------|
| CVE-2024-XXXX | Web Server 1 | Critical | 10-Feb-2025 | RAF-12345 | Approved |

📄 **Key Evidence:** RAF Form with **management signatures and approval timestamps**.

## **5. Conclusion**
A **successful vulnerability management audit** ensures that:  
✅ All assets are scanned regularly.  
✅ Vulnerabilities are prioritized and remediated within SLA.  
✅ SLA breaches are documented, and risks are formally accepted via RAF.  
✅ Continuous monitoring and reporting improve security posture.
