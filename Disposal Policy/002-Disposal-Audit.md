# Disposal Policy – Control Domain Audit Flow

## STEP 1: Identify the Control Owner via Kickoff Meetings

### Schedule the Kickoff Meeting:
- Arrange an initial meeting with key stakeholders.
- Ensure participation from the control owner (CO) responsible for the disposal policy.

### Confirm Control Ownership:
- Identify the CO, noting their name and designation.
- Record the meeting timestamp for audit tracking purposes.

### Define the Scope:
- Confirm that the disposal policy covers end-of-life (EOL) asset tracking.
- Clarify the types of assets covered (devices containing PII, SPII, BSI, and PHI) and asset handling procedures.

## STEP 2: Inquiry – Process Related to Disposal Control

### Initiate the Inquiry with the Control Owner (CO):
- Interview the CO and document their name, designation, and the inquiry’s timestamp.

### Key Inquiry Points:

#### Tracking of EOL Life-cycle & Asset Handling:
- Ask how the organization tracks assets that reach EOL.
- Verify if there are specific processes for handling assets containing sensitive data (PII, SPII, PHI, BSI).

#### Vendor and Third-Party Off-Boarding:
- Determine if, when off-boarding a vendor or third-party, the organization securely disposes of all the assets used by that vendor.

#### Outsourced Disposal:
- Confirm whether a trusted third-party vendor has been hired to perform the disposal activity.

#### Methods of Data Disposal:
- Request details on which disposal methods are used (e.g., degaussing, puncturing, shredding).
- Ask for evidence or documentation on the procedures followed.

## STEP 3: Walkthrough – Testing, Sampling, and Evidence Collection

### Arrange a Walkthrough Session:
- Coordinate a walkthrough session with the CO or a designated team representative.
- Record the session details (Name, Designation, Timestamp).

### Examine the Audit Period Data:
- Focus on the specified audit period (e.g., Feb 2022 – Feb 2023).
- Ask: “Do you have any assets that have reached EOL during this period?”
  - *Example Response:* “Yes, we have 10 assets that have reached EOL.”

### Verify Asset Tracking:
- Check for the corresponding COD (Certificate of Disposal or similar tracking code) for each of the 10 assets.
- Confirm that all assets with EOL have a recorded and verified disposal record.

### Vendor Off-Boarding Verification:
- Confirm if any vendor or third-party was off-boarded during the audit period.
  - *Example Response:* “Yes, we off-boarded a vendor when we migrated our infrastructure from Rackspace to Microsoft Azure.”
- Obtain and review the asset register for Rackspace.
- Verify that each asset in the Rackspace register has a corresponding COD and that the disposal was conducted securely.

### Collect and Cross-Verify Evidence:
- Gather relevant documentation (asset registers, COD records, third-party vendor certifications, disposal method details).
- Ensure that evidence clearly shows the secure disposal process and compliance with the disposal policy.
- Note any discrepancies or missing documentation for follow-up.

## Final Step: Compile Audit Findings & Reporting

### Summarize Observations:
- List all the assets that reached EOL and confirm their disposal status.
- Document how the disposal process was managed for both in-house assets and those handled by third-party vendors.

### Identify Gaps or Non-Compliance:
- Highlight any issues, such as missing CODs, incomplete documentation, or deviations from the established disposal methods.

### Provide Recommendations:
- Suggest improvements for asset tracking, documentation, or the disposal process to ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.

### Finalize the Audit Report:
- Present the audit findings to key stakeholders.
- Include detailed evidence, observations, and recommended corrective actions.
- Ensure the report is reviewed and signed off by the appropriate authorities.
