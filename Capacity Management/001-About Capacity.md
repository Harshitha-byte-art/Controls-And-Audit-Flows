# Capacity Management – Detailed Explanation

## 1. Introduction to Capacity Management
Capacity Management ensures that IT resources such as servers, networks, databases, and storage devices are continuously monitored and optimized to meet current and future business needs. The primary goal is to ensure system availability, performance, and efficiency while preventing capacity-related failures.

## 2. Control Type & Information Security Properties
### Control Type: Preventive & Detective
- **Preventive Controls**: Monitor and manage system capacity to prevent failures.
- **Detective Controls**: Identify potential capacity issues before they impact system performance.

### Information Security Properties:
- **Integrity**: Ensuring that data processing and storage remain accurate and reliable.
- **Availability**: Ensuring IT systems remain operational by effectively managing system resources.

## 3. Capacity Management Control & Monitoring Process
### Objective:
The organization must monitor and adjust resource usage (e.g., servers, networks, databases, applications, and storage) to ensure uninterrupted business operations.

### Key Capacity Management Activities:
#### Identify Capacity Requirements:
- Determine the necessary capacity for:
  - **IT Infrastructure** (Servers, Databases, Networks, Storage).
  - **Human Resources** (Teams managing monitoring and maintenance).
  - **Facilities & Office Resources** (Cloud Storage, Data Centers).
- Consider **business criticality** in determining capacity needs.

#### System Monitoring & Performance Optimization:
- Apply **system tuning** to improve resource efficiency.
- Ensure **high availability** by dynamically adjusting system load.

#### Stress-Testing & Performance Evaluation:
- Conduct **regular stress-tests** to verify system capability under peak loads.
- Identify **potential bottlenecks** before they affect performance.

#### Detective Controls for Capacity Monitoring:
- Use **real-time monitoring tools** to track system resource usage.
- Set up **alerts and notifications** for abnormal capacity levels.

## 4. Capacity Monitoring Team & Responsibilities
### Capacity Team (Infrastructure Team)
**Responsible for monitoring:**
- **Servers**
- **Networks**
- **Databases**
- **Storage devices**

Ensures that resources such as **CPU, RAM, Network, Applications, and Databases** have sufficient capacity.

### Monitoring Team (Cloud Team)
- Monitors **cloud-based resources**.
- Key monitoring parameters:
  - **Memory Utilization**
  - **Disk Utilization**
  - **CPU Utilization**

## 5. Capacity Thresholds & Alert Levels
Monitoring tools track resource usage, and alerts are triggered when usage crosses predefined limits.

### Threshold Limits & Severity Levels
| **Usage Level** | **Severity Level** | **Example (Disk Utilization: 100GB Storage)** | **Alert Color** |
|---------------|----------------|---------------------------------|--------------|
| **65% Usage** | Medium (**P3**) | 65GB used → Warning | **Yellow** |
| **75% Usage** | High (**P2**) | 75GB used → High Alert | **Orange** |
| **85%-95% Usage** | Critical (**P1**) | 85GB used → Critical | **Red** |

### Actions Based on Alert Levels:
- **P3 (Medium Alert - Yellow):**
  - Capacity reaches **65% usage**.
  - Monitoring team **reviews the system** and takes preventive action.

- **P2 (High Alert - Orange):**
  - Capacity reaches **75% usage**.
  - Monitoring team **analyzes system load** and prepares for scaling or optimization.

- **P1 (Critical Alert - Red):**
  - Capacity exceeds **85%-95% usage**.
  - **Immediate action required** to prevent system failure.

## 6. Incident Handling & Ticketing Process
### Email Alerts & Ticketing Workflow
- The **monitoring tool automatically triggers an email alert** when capacity exceeds the defined thresholds.
- The **monitoring team receives alerts and creates tickets** for issue resolution.
- Alerts are forwarded to the **Distribution List (DL)** to notify all relevant team members.

### Service Level Agreement (SLA) for Ticket Resolution
| **Priority Level** | **Resolution Time** |
|-------------------|----------------|
| **P1 (Critical Issue)** | 12 hours |
| **P2 (High Issue)** | 24 hours (1 day) |
| **P3 (Medium Issue)** | 3 days (72 hours) |

## 7. Distribution List (DL) – Capacity Alerts Recipients
- **Primary Distribution List:** monitor@abc.com
- **Team Members Receiving Alerts:**
  - **Mounika@abc.com**
  - **Megana@abc.com**
  - **Manoj@abc.com**
  - **Sunitha@abc.com**

### Automated Alerting System
- The **monitoring tool automatically sends email alerts** when thresholds are exceeded.
- The **monitoring team is responsible for taking corrective actions** based on the severity level.

## 8. Summary of Capacity Management Best Practices
| **Key Activity** | **Purpose** |
|---------------|------------|
| **Capacity Monitoring** | Ensures system resources meet operational needs. |
| **Threshold Alerts & Notifications** | Detect and respond to capacity issues proactively. |
| **Automated Email Alerts** | Notify relevant teams when limits are exceeded. |
| **Incident Tracking & SLA** | Ensure timely issue resolution. |
