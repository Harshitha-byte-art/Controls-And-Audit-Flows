# SOA Document (Statement of Applicability)

## A. Definition and Purpose

Defines list of applicable and non-applicable controls of the organization.

### **SOA (Statement of Applicability):**
- A document that lists all the assessable information security controls as specified in Annex A of the ISO 27001 standard.
- Identifies which controls have been selected by an organization based on its risk assessment and risk treatment plan.

## B. Importance for ISO 27001 Compliance and Audit

### **Audit Relevance:**
- **First Point of Reference:** Auditors look for the SOA at the beginning of an ISO 27001 audit.
- **Mandatory Requirement:** The SOA is considered the “heart of the ISMS” and must be available during the audit.
- **Evidence of Control Implementation:** Demonstrates which controls are in place and how they address the identified risks.

## C. Key Characteristics

### **Comprehensive Listing:**
- Contains all relevant security controls (assessable controls) from Annex A.

### **Dynamic Nature:**
- Reflects changes over time as risks evolve and controls are updated.

### **Documentation Role:**
- Serves as a central document linking the risk assessment to the security measures implemented.
