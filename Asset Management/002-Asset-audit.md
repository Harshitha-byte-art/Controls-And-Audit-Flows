# Asset Management Control Flow

## STEP 1: Identify the Control Owner via Kickoff Meetings
- Conduct a kickoff meeting to identify the **Control Owner** responsible for asset management.

## STEP 2: Inquiry With Control Owner
- Are you maintaining an **asset inventory** of all the assets in your organization?
- Are you using any **tool** to store asset details, such as an **asset register**, or is it stored manually in an **Excel sheet**?
- Is the **asset criticality and ownership** defined and labeled?
- Is the **end of lifecycle (EOL)** being tracked?

## STEP 3: Walkthrough (Audit)
- Verify if the **asset register is up to date** (ensuring all assets are recorded until the latest date).
- **Re-confirm asset location** by manually verifying with the **server room** to ensure all assets are accounted for.
- Check if assets are **classified based on CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)**.
- Ensure **end of lifecycle (EOL) tracking** is in place.
- Confirm that **ownership is assigned** for all assets.
- If asset details are stored in an **Excel sheet**, it must be **approved by the Control Owner** before being considered as valid evidence in asset management.

## Core Points
- **Are we using any tools to maintain control?**
- **Do you think the evidence gathered is sufficient?**
- **Who is the accountable person for the control?**
- **Is the evidence complete and accurate?**
- **The Excel sheet should be approved by the Control Owner.**
