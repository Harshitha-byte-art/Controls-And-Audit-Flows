# Key Management System (KMS) & Key Management Procedure

A **Key Management System (KMS)** is a framework that ensures the secure generation, distribution, storage, usage, rotation, and disposal of encryption keys. Effective key management is critical for maintaining data security and compliance with industry standards.

## 1. Key Management Procedure (Encryption Procedure Document)
The Key Management Procedure defines the guidelines and protocols for managing encryption keys securely. This includes key inventory, access controls, encryption, logging, and key rotation.

## 2. Inventory of Keys (A8)
The inventory of encryption keys includes a detailed list of all cryptographic keys used in the organization. The inventory should contain the following details:

### Key Inventory Information:
- **Key Name/ID:** Unique identifier for each key
- **Key Type:** Symmetric (AES, DES) or Asymmetric (RSA, ECC)
- **Key Owner:** The responsible person or team managing the key
- **Key Classification:** Confidential, Restricted, Public
- **Acceptable Usage:** Specific applications or data encryption purposes
- **Handling Guidelines:** Secure storage, sharing policies
- **Disposal/Returning of Keys:** Process for key revocation and deletion
- **Labelling & Metadata:** Expiry date, rotation frequency

All keys should be documented and classified according to security levels and access permissions.

## 3. Access to Keys (A9)
Access to encryption keys must be strictly controlled, requiring proper approvals and justifications.

### Access Control Workflow:
#### **Access Request:**
- Submitted via a **ticketing system**
- Requires **business justification** for key access
- Specifies access **duration**

#### **Approval Process:**
- Verified by security administrators
- Requires **manager approval**

#### **Access Permission Levels:**
- **Library Function or Site Permission** (Who can access key inventory)
- **VPN Access** (Required for remote access)
- **Key Inventory Access** (Controlled and logged)

#### **Justification for Access to Key Inventory:**
- The **reason for needing access** must be documented
- Access is **time-bound** and reviewed periodically

### **VPN Access Flow:**
1. **User Connects to VPN**
2. **SSL-VPN Authentication** (Secure connection established)
3. **User Identity Verified**
4. **Network Access Granted**

## 4. Encryption of Keys (A10)
Encryption keys themselves must be securely stored and backed up to prevent unauthorized access or compromise.

### **Backup of Keys:**
- **Primary Storage:** Data Centre in Bangalore
- **Backup Vault:** Secure key server in Mumbai
- **Encryption of Backups:** Keys must be encrypted before backup

### **Key Availability Considerations:**
- Redundancy must be ensured for **high availability**
- If keys are compromised, an **emergency procedure** must be followed

### **Compromised Key Handling Procedure:**
1. **Incident Detection:** If a key is suspected to be compromised
2. **Key Revocation:** Immediate removal from inventory
3. **New Key Generation:** Securely replace the compromised key
4. **Data Re-encryption:** If necessary, affected data should be re-encrypted

## 5. Key Access Logs & Monitoring
All access and usage of keys should be logged in a **Log Server** for security auditing.

### **Logging Details:**
- **Access Time & Date**
- **User Identity (Who accessed the key)**
- **Reason for Access**
- **System/Device Used**
- **Changes Made** (if any)

### **Disposal of Keys:**
- **When:** Upon contract termination or when the key is no longer required
- **Process:**  
  1. **Confirmation on Contract Termination**
  2. **Business Justification for Key Deletion**
  3. **Secure Deletion (Validated & Logged)**

## 6. Key Rotation Policy
Key rotation ensures security by periodically replacing encryption keys.

### **Key Rotation Process (Every 3 Months):**
1. **Delete Old Key:** Ensure it is securely removed from all systems
2. **Generate New Key:** Using a secure key generation method
3. **Update Key Inventory:** Document the new key details
4. **Distribute New Key:** Ensure only authorized users receive it
5. **Revoke Access to Old Key:** Prevent unauthorized usage

### **Why Key Rotation is Necessary?**
- Reduces risk of key compromise
- Ensures compliance with security policies
- Prevents long-term exposure of encryption keys
