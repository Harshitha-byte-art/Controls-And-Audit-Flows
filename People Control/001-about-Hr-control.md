# People Control (HR) for Review

## Overview
**People control**, also known as HR Security, ensures that employees follow security protocols to minimize risks:
- **Before Employment**: Employee screening, background verification, and security agreements.
- **During Employment**: Security training, access control, and policy compliance.
- **After Employment**: Exit procedures, access revocation, and data protection.

### HR Security Compliance Lists (ISO 27001)
| HR List Type        | Purpose                                      |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Master Employee List** | Includes new employees (Before Employment) |
| **Active Employee List** | Includes current employees (During Employment) |
| **Exit List**         | Includes terminated employees (After Employment) |

## Phases of HR Security

### 1. Before Employment (Pre-Employment Screening & Onboarding)
#### Step 1: Background Verification (BGV) Check
- HR conducts **BGV checks** on all candidates.
- Procedures for BGV are documented in HR policy and procedure documents.

#### Step 2: Reviewing Policy & Procedure Documents
- Audit teams review HR policy and procedure documents to ensure alignment with compliance standards.
- Control activities must follow laws, regulations, and ethical hiring guidelines.

#### Step 3: Employment Terms & Agreements
- Employment contracts include:
  - Confidentiality Agreements (Non-Disclosure Agreements - NDA)
  - Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)
  - Data Protection Agreements
- Employees sign and acknowledge policies during onboarding.

#### Step 4: Sampling for Audit
- HR maintains records of new joiners.
- Sampling method for audit:
  - Total population data (e.g., 600 new employees).
  - A random sample of 25 employees is selected for review.
  - HR policies and agreements are checked for compliance.

### 2. During Employment
#### Information Security Awareness
- Regular training and updates for employees on relevant security policies.
- Evidence: Awareness training calendar and code of conduct.

#### Disciplinary Process
- Formal process for addressing security policy violations.

### 3. After Employment
#### Post-Employment Responsibilities
- Define and enforce security duties after employment ends.
- Evidence: Documented post-employment obligations.

#### Confidentiality Agreements
- Maintain and review confidentiality agreements (NDAs) to protect sensitive information.
- Evidence: Signed NDAs and review records.
