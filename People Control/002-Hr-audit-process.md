## HR Control Audit Flow and Process

### Step 1: Identify the Control Owner
- Identify the Control Owner (CO) via kick-off meetings.
- Capture information:
  - Name
  - Designation
  - Email ID

### Step 2: Inquiry
- Conduct inquiry with the Control Owner (CO) on HR procedures.
- Sample questions:
  - What laws and regulations apply during BGV?
  - Is BGV conducted by your organization or a third party?
    - If third-party: Are reports shared in a template format?
  - Is BGV completed within 90 days of joining?
    - If delayed (e.g., 240 days), record as a deviation.

#### Deviation/Gap Identification
- If BGV is delayed, identify as a deviation.
- Management justification (e.g., "COVID-19 lockdown delays").

### Step 3: Walkthrough
- Conduct testing, sampling, and evidence gathering:
  - Over-the-shoulder testing (e.g., screen-sharing session).
  - If no evidence is gathered, document it.
  - Mask IT data to preserve employee confidentiality.
- **Sampling**:
  - Create a master list.
  - Select a sample for evidence collection.
  - Collect BGV reports to confirm compliance.
    #### Core Points for Review
- **Tools**: Are tools used to maintain BGV control?
- **Evidence Sufficiency**: Is the evidence sufficient?
- **Accountability**: Who is accountable for this control?
- **Evidence Confirmation**: Are gathered documents verifiable?
